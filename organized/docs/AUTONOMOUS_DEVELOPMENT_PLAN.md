# Autonomous Development Plan - 12 Hour Night Shift
**Start Time**: 6:50 PM PST, Aug 17, 2025
**End Time**: 6:50 AM PST, Aug 18, 2025
**Goal**: Achieve 1000+ Kaggle score through systematic improvements

## Phase 1: Integration (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- [ ] Create unified championship agent integrating all components
- [ ] Test integrated agent thoroughly
- [ ] Submit to Kaggle for baseline

## Phase 2: Self-Play Generation (10:00 PM - 2:00 AM)
- [ ] Run 10M+ game self-play overnight
- [ ] Generate comprehensive opening book
- [ ] Create endgame tablebase for 8-piece positions

## Phase 3: Neural Network Training (2:00 AM - 5:00 AM)
- [ ] Design CNN architecture for position evaluation
- [ ] Train on self-play data
- [ ] Integrate with search engine

## Phase 4: Final Optimization (5:00 AM - 6:50 AM)
- [ ] Parameter tuning
- [ ] Speed optimization
- [ ] Final submission preparation

## Automated Tasks Running:
1. Self-play generation (continuous)
2. Kaggle submission monitoring
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Opening book building

## Success Metrics:
- Target Score: 1000+ (Top 25)
- Stretch Goal: 1400+ (Top 10)
- Games Generated: 10M+
- Search Depth: 15+ ply
- Response Time: <10ms
