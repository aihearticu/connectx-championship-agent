2. **Integrated Agents**: After NN completion
3. **Performance Reports**: During testing phases

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Minimum Success (TOP 15)
- Bitboard integration complete
- 10x performance improvement
- Stable submissions

### Target Success (TOP 10)
- Neural network integrated
- 95%+ win rate vs strong agents
- Sub-50ms response times

### Stretch Goal (TOP 5)
- Hybrid optimization complete
- 99%+ tactical accuracy
- Best-in-class performance

## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
1. **NN Too Large**: Pre-compute weights, compress
2. **Bitboard Bugs**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout
3. **Time Limits**: Aggressive time management
4. **Memory Issues**: Profile and optimize

### Strategic Risks
1. **Competition Updates**: Monitor leaderboard
2. **Regression**: Keep TOP 25 baseline ready
3. **Submission Failures**: Test in Kaggle first
4. **Complexity Creep**: Remember "simple beats complex"

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Update Schedule
- Every 2 hours during active development
- Immediate alerts for issues
- Daily summary reports
- Phase completion reviews

### Decision Gates
1. **Bitboard Go/No-Go**: After performance validation
2. **NN Integration Go/No-Go**: After Kaggle testing
3. **TOP 5 Submission Go/No-Go**: After full validation
