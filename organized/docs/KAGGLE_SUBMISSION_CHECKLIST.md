- [ ] **Function signature correct**
  ```python
  def agent(observation, configuration):
      # Must return int 0-6
  ```
  
- [ ] **Return type validation**
  - [ ] Returns `int` not `float`
  - [ ] Returns value 0-6 inclusive
  - [ ] Never returns None or raises exception

### 2. Error Handling ✓

  - [ ] Never crashes on any input
  
- [ ] **Edge cases handled**
  - [ ] Empty board (first move)
  - [ ] Nearly full board
  - [ ] Single column remaining
  - [ ] Opponent about to win

### 3. Performance Requirements ✓
- [ ] **Time constraints**
  - [ ] Average move < 100ms
  - [ ] Worst case < 1000ms
  - [ ] Time management implemented
  
- [ ] **Memory usage**
  - [ ] Total usage < 100MB
  - [ ] No memory leaks
  - [ ] Efficient data structures

### 4. Testing Validation ✓
- [ ] **Local testing complete**
  ```bash
  python test_submission_locally.py
  ```
  - [ ] 1000+ games vs random
  - [ ] 100+ games vs minimax
  - [ ] All test cases pass
  
- [ ] **Win rate targets**
  - [ ] 100% vs random
  - [ ] 95%+ vs OneStep
  - [ ] No illegal moves
  
- [ ] **Kaggle notebook test**
  - [ ] Create test notebook
  - [ ] Import and run agent
  - [ ] Verify no errors

### 5. Specific Validations ✓

#### For Neural Network Agent:
- [ ] Model weights embedded (no file loading)
- [ ] Pure Python forward pass
- [ ] Inference time < 50ms
- [ ] Fallback to minimax ready

#### For Bitboard Agent:
- [ ] Bitboard conversion correct
- [ ] Win detection accurate
- [ ] No bit manipulation errors
- [ ] Speed improvement verified

#### For Hybrid Agent:
- [ ] Algorithm switching works
- [ ] Time management effective
- [ ] Both components tested
- [ ] Smooth transitions

### 6. Submission Preparation ✓
- [ ] **File preparation**
  - [ ] Correct filename: `submission.py`
  - [ ] Remove all debug prints
  - [ ] Remove validation code
  - [ ] Clean comments
  
- [ ] **Final code review**
  - [ ] Logic flow clear
  - [ ] No obvious bugs
  - [ ] Follows style guide

### 7. Submission Execution ✓
- [ ] **Submission command ready**
  ```bash
  kaggle competitions submit -c connectx -f submission.py -m "Message"
  ```
  
- [ ] **Submission message prepared**
  - Descriptive and accurate
  - Mentions key features
  - Version tracking

### 8. Post-Submission ✓
- [ ] **Monitor status**
  ```bash
  kaggle competitions submissions -c connectx
  ```
  
- [ ] **Check for errors**
  - [ ] Submission processed
  - [ ] No error messages
  - [ ] Score received
  
- [ ] **Track performance**
  - [ ] Initial ranking
  - [ ] Score trend
  - [ ] Game replays

## COMMON FAILURE MODES

### Import Errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG
import numpy as np

# ✅ CORRECT
# Use pure Python only
```

### Return Type Errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG
return 3.0  # float
return best_moves[0]  # might be numpy type

# ✅ CORRECT
return int(3)
return int(best_moves[0])
```

### Timeout Issues
```python
# ❌ WRONG
depth = 15  # Too deep, might timeout

# ✅ CORRECT
depth = min(8, time_remaining_based_depth())
```

### Memory Issues
```python
# ❌ WRONG
cache = {}  # Unbounded growth

# ✅ CORRECT
cache = {}
if len(cache) > 1000000:
    cache.clear()
```

## EMERGENCY FIXES

If submission fails:

1. **Check error message** - Usually indicates the issue
2. **Revert to simpler version** - TOP 25 baseline works
3. **Remove recent changes** - Isolate the problem
4. **Test in Kaggle notebook** - Reproduce the issue
5. **Apply minimal fix** - Don't over-engineer

## SUBMISSION LOG

Track each submission:

| Date | Version | Score | Rank | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|------|-------|
| 2025-05-23 | v3.0 | 830 | 25 | Simple minimax breakthrough |
| 2025-05-25 | v4.0 | TBD | TBD | Bitboard enhancement |
| 2025-05-25 | v5.0 | TBD | TBD | Neural network integration |

## FINAL REMINDERS

1. **Test locally first** - Never submit untested code
2. **Keep it simple** - Our success proves this
3. **Have fallbacks** - Always have Plan B
4. **Monitor closely** - Watch initial games
5. **Document everything** - Track what works
