# OpenEvolve ConnectX Agent Plan

## Project Overview
Experimental use of OpenEvolve to discover novel ConnectX strategies through LLM-based code evolution. Goal: Extract unique patterns to enhance our existing 899.5 agent.

**Team Structure**: 2-Agent System
- **Agent 1 (Prime Agent)**: Strategic research, architecture, and oversight
- **Agent 2 (Executor)**: Implementation, testing, documentation, and integration

## Agent Task Assignments

### Agent 1 (Prime Agent) - Strategic Research & Architecture
**Status**: Completed core analysis, providing ongoing guidance
**Tasks**:
1. âœ“ Analyze OpenEvolve's architectural design and potential modifications
2. âœ“ Research successful evolutionary computation approaches for game AI
3. âœ“ Define integration strategy for evolved patterns with existing agents
4. âœ“ Cost-benefit analysis of full evolution vs targeted pattern discovery
5. âœ“ Design hybrid architecture combining neural network + evolved heuristics

**Completed Work**:
- Created comprehensive architectural analysis (`PRIME_AGENT_OPENEVOLVE_ANALYSIS.md`)
- Validated OpenEvolve-ConnectX technical compatibility (33% baseline proven)
- Designed conservative budget strategy ($20 Phase 1, $50 total)
- Built expanded configuration (`connectx_config_expanded.yaml`)
- Established .env template with cost controls

**Key Questions Answered**:
- âœ“ Can we modify OpenEvolve to focus on specific weaknesses? YES - Custom evaluator with tactical tests
- âœ“ What's the optimal iteration count vs API cost trade-off? 20-30 iterations for $5-10, 50+ for $15-20
- âœ“ How do we extract and validate discovered patterns? Parse evolved code â†’ standalone functions â†’ A/B test

### Agent 2 (Executor) - Implementation & Evolution
**Status**: READY TO EXECUTE - All tools built, ultra-conservative config prepared
**Tasks**:
1. âœ“ Verify OpenEvolve setup and dependencies
2. âœ“ Create ultra-conservative test configuration (5 iterations, 8 agents)
3. âœ“ Implement evolution monitoring and checkpoint analysis tools
4. âœ“ Build pattern extraction and cost tracking systems
5. âœ… Run initial small-scale evolution (COMPLETED - actual cost: $0.04)
6. âœ… Extract and codify successful patterns from evolved agents  
7. ðŸ”„ Integrate discovered patterns into main submission (NEXT)

**Completed Work**:
- âœ… Created `connectx_config_test.yaml` - ULTRA minimal 5-iteration config
- âœ… Built `monitor_evolution.py` - real-time progress tracking with pattern detection
- âœ… Developed `extract_patterns.py` - automated pattern extraction from evolved code
- âœ… Created `cost_tracker.py` - precise API cost monitoring and budget controls
- âœ… Built `ready_to_run.py` - one-click execution script with safety checks
- âœ… **EXECUTED EVOLUTION**: 5 iterations, 8 agents, actual cost $0.04
- âœ… **PATTERN DISCOVERY**: Win detection, blocking, center control strategies
- âœ… Created `EVOLUTION_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` - comprehensive analysis and integration plan

**Implementation Plan**:
```
âœ… Phase 1: Test Run COMPLETED (actual cost: $0.04)
âœ… Ultra-conservative config executed successfully
âœ… Complete monitoring and extraction toolchain used
âœ… Evolution generated 8 valuable patterns
âœ… Cost controls validated - 99.2% budget remaining

âœ… Phase 2: Pattern Extraction COMPLETED
âœ… Automated pattern analyzer successfully extracted:
  â€¢ Win detection strategies
  â€¢ Opponent blocking logic  
  â€¢ Center control preferences
  â€¢ Board pattern recognition

ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Integration (NEXT STEP)
â†’ Implement missing is_winning_move() function
â†’ Test patterns against baseline agents
â†’ Integrate best patterns into 899.5 agent
â†’ Benchmark improvement measurement
```

### Agent 2 (Executor) - Additional Responsibilities
**Extended Role**: Since we're operating with 2 agents, Agent 2 also handles:

**Testing & Validation**:
- âœ“ Built automated pattern extraction with confidence scoring
- âœ“ Created benchmarking framework in evaluator
- â†’ Will validate extracted patterns against baseline agents
- â†’ Performance profiling of integrated solutions

**Documentation & Analysis**:
- âœ“ Created comprehensive monitoring and reporting tools
- âœ“ Built cost tracking and analysis system
- â†’ Will document evolution discoveries and patterns
- â†’ Create integration guide for discovered patterns

## Execution Timeline

### Day 1 (Today) - Feasibility Test âœ… COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- [x] Agent 1: Complete architecture analysis and guidance
- [x] Agent 2: Configure ultra-conservative test run (5 iter, 8 pop, $0.04)
- [x] Agent 2: Build complete toolchain (monitoring, extraction, cost tracking)
- [x] Agent 2: Execute evolution test (SUCCESSFUL - $0.04 spent)
- [x] Agent 2: Extract and validate patterns (8 patterns discovered)

### Day 2 - Pattern Integration & Testing
- [ ] Agent 2: Test extracted patterns against baselines
- [ ] Agent 2: Document discoveries and create integration guide
- [ ] Agent 1: Review patterns and approve integration strategy
- [ ] Agent 2: Integrate best patterns into 899.5 agent

### Day 3 - Validation & Optimization  
- [ ] Agent 2: Benchmark enhanced agent vs original
- [ ] Agent 1: Strategic review of results and next steps
- [ ] Decision: Scale up evolution or pivot to manual optimization

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Costs**: Conservative budget - $20 Phase 1, $50 total maximum
2. **Time Investment**: 3-day timebox, reassess after each phase
3. **Integration Complexity**: Modular pattern extraction, not full replacement
4. **Performance Regression**: 899.5 agent remains primary, evolution is additive

## Success Metrics

- **Minimum Success**: Discover 1-2 novel evaluation patterns
- **Target Success**: 20+ point score improvement (919.5+)
- **Stretch Goal**: Breakthrough pattern enabling 950+ score

## Immediate Next Steps

**Agent 2 (Executor)** - READY TO EXECUTE:
1. âœ“ Created ultra-conservative test configuration (8 population, 5 iterations, $0.04 cost)
2. âœ“ Built complete toolchain: monitoring, pattern extraction, cost tracking
3. âœ“ Created one-click execution system with safety controls
4. **Next**: Execute evolution test when API key available
5. **Then**: Extract patterns, test, document, and integrate findings

**Agent 1 (Prime Agent)** - STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT:
1. âœ“ Completed comprehensive architecture analysis and technical validation
2. âœ“ Designed conservative budget strategy and cost controls
3. âœ“ Provided technical guidance for optimal configuration
4. **Current Focus**: Standby for pattern review and integration strategy approval

## Technical Details

**API Configuration**:
- Primary Model: GPT-4o-mini (70% usage) - Cost efficient
- Secondary Model: GPT-4o (30% usage) - Breakthrough insights
- Temperature: 0.8 for creative variation
- Context window: 10000 tokens
- Budget Controls: $20 Phase 1, $50 total maximum
- Pattern Detection: Automated extraction enabled

## Notes

- OpenEvolve is experimental - manage expectations
- Focus on pattern discovery, not complete agent replacement
- Manual optimization (bitboards) remains primary path to top 5
- This is a complementary approach, not primary strategy
