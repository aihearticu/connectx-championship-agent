    1. Our agents are NOT using bitboard operations (slow)
    2. Search depth is likely too shallow (5-7 vs needed 10-12)
    3. No proper opening book (Connect 4 is solved!)
    4. Missing odd-even strategy
    5. Transposition tables not optimized
    
    TOP PRIORITY FIXES:
    - Implement REAL bitboard with fast win detection
    - Use solved opening book for first 8-10 moves
    - Increase search depth to 10-12 ply
    - Add odd-even strategy awareness
