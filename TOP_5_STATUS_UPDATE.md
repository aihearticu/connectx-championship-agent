- Max response time: 2.9ms (well under limit)

### 2. Timeout Crisis Resolved ‚úÖ
- Identified root cause: Complex operations in hot path
- Solution: Simplified evaluation, embedded weights
- Result: Zero timeouts in extensive testing

### 3. Research Completed ‚úÖ
- Deep analysis of TOP 5 techniques
- Identified critical improvements needed:
  - Bitboards (100x speedup)
  - Transposition tables (avoid redundant calculations)
  - Killer move heuristic (better move ordering)
  - Extended opening book (perfect early game)

## üöÄ Tomorrow's Battle Plan

### Submission 1 (Morning) - Enhanced Baseline
**Goal**: Stable 850-900 score
```python
# Key improvements:
- 3-ply minimax with alpha-beta
- Transposition table (1M entries)
- Killer move heuristic
- Enhanced threat detection
- Target: <5ms per move
```

### Submission 2 (Evening) - TOP 5 Push
**Goal**: Break 950+ score
```python
# Advanced features:
- Bitboard implementation (if morning succeeds)
- 5-7 ply search depth
- Pattern-based evaluation
- Extended opening book (20+ moves)
- Endgame tablebase
```

## üî¨ Technical Insights

### What We've Learned:
1. **Speed > Intelligence**: 2-ply fast beats 8-ply slow
2. **Kaggle's limits are strict**: ~10ms hard timeout
3. **Simple wins detection is 90%**: Never miss obvious moves
4. **Center control = victory**: Worth 0.5-1.0 pawns

### What TOP 5 Players Have:
1. **Bitboards**: 100x faster board operations
2. **Deep search**: 10-12 ply consistently
3. **Perfect tactics**: Never miss any threat
4. **Opening knowledge**: 30+ move opening books
5. **Endgame mastery**: Tablebase for perfect play
