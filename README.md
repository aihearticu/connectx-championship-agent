- **Win Rate vs Negamax**: 85% (17/20 games)
- **Execution Speed**: 0.078ms max (ultra-fast)
- **Overall Score**: 91.0/100

## Features

### 1. Ultra-Fast Execution
- Average execution time: 0.042ms
- Maximum execution time: 0.078ms
- No risk of timeouts in competition

### 2. Comprehensive Opening Book
- 45+ optimal positions based on perfect play theory
- Covers critical first 8-12 moves
- Based on Connect 4 being a solved game

### 3. Strategic Evaluation

## Quick Start

### Running the Agent
```python
from kaggle_environments import make
import submission

# Create environment
env = make("connectx")

# Play against random
env.run([submission.agent, "random"])
print(env.render())
```

### Testing Performance
```bash
python test_strategies.py
```

### Submitting to Kaggle
```bash
kaggle competitions submit -c connectx -f submission.py -m "Your message"
```
