# Tomorrow's Action Plan - May 26, 2025

## 🌅 Morning Tasks (6:00 AM PST)

### 1. Check Results
- [ ] Check score for NN submission (submitted 11:26 PM)
- [ ] Check score for TOP 5 Push (submitted 12:00 AM)
- [ ] Note current rank
- [ ] Analyze performance

### 2. Decision Tree

#### If TOP 5 Push scores 950+:
- 🎉 CELEBRATE! We likely made TOP 5-10!
- Focus on minor optimizations
- Consider adding:
  - Transposition tables
  - Deeper search (5-6 ply)
  - Better time management

#### If TOP 5 Push scores 850-950:
- Good progress! TOP 10-20 range
- Morning submission:
  - Add transposition tables
  - Implement killer moves
  - Increase depth to 5
- Evening submission:
  - Full optimization push
  - Consider bitboards

#### If TOP 5 Push scores <850:
- Something went wrong
- Debug and analyze
- Revert to proven approaches
- Focus on stability

### 3. Morning Submission (if needed)

**Option A - Enhancement** (if score 850+):
```python
# Add to current agent:
- Transposition table (1M entries)
- Killer move heuristic
- Depth 5 search
- Keep time limit at 6ms
```

**Option B - Recovery** (if score <850):
```python
# Simplified approach:
- Pure minimax depth 3
- No complex evaluation
- Focus on speed
- Perfect tactics only
```

### 4. Research Tasks

- [ ] Analyze top players' recent games
- [ ] Study any new strategies
- [ ] Check leaderboard changes
- [ ] Read competition forums

## 🌆 Evening Strategy (6:00 PM PST)

Based on morning results:

1. **If close to TOP 5**: Make final optimization push
2. **If in TOP 10-15**: Add advanced features carefully
3. **If struggling**: Focus on consistency

## 📝 Key Learnings to Apply

1. **Speed > Depth**: 3-ply fast beats 8-ply slow
2. **Reliability > Features**: No timeouts ever
3. **Testing > Hoping**: Test 10k+ positions
4. **Incremental > Revolutionary**: Small improvements

## 🎯 Ultimate Goal

**TOP 5 by end of weekend**

We have:
- The knowledge
- The code
- The determination
- 2 fresh submissions tomorrow
